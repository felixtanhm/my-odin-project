### Reflections & Thoughts

At the time of writing this post, I'm about halfway through the Full Stack Javascript path of The Odin Project (TOP). It's at a point where I've decided to slow down a little; to consolidate, reflect and map out next steps. Looking back on my journey in learning to code, I smile and feel a little proud.

TOP was not my first foray into learning to code, though that's a backstory for another post. Having gone through a number of programs, it is however, the first curriculum that really clicked with me. It is also the only program where I have **completed** portfolio projects that I can show for. A key magic moment for me was while building Rock, Paper, Scissors. Somehow, from a blank slate, I could build the neccessary functions to make the game work. Time just flew from then onwards and months later, I'm still going through it. Crazy. 🤯

In pausing to reflect and take it all in, I believe this is how The Odin Project struck a chord with me:

- **Incremental**: TOP dishes out topics and concepts in very small, incremental amounts. It also pauses at the right moments with Projects, and in building said Projects, your understanding of previously mentioned topics and concepts are solidified. Other programs I've tried wait too long to do this, with too little projects. As a result, projects in other programs become too large of a beast to overcome.
- **Self Paced**: If you can't understand something, you can spend as long as you like in reading, rereading, triple reading. Projects can also be done anytime. They can be incredibly fleshed out, or you can do as little as you like - there's no pressure as long as you feel that you understand the main concept at hand. This is in contrast to Bootcamps, where there's a time pressure to finish projects, and these projects are often positioned as your portfolio; so they have to be fleshed out as best as you can. I remember procrastinating for ages with Etch A Sketch. Somehow the concept of humble 'o me, being able to build a pixel drawing tool, seemed impossible. I was scared, and it took me a week or so to eventually put the code equivalent of "pen to paper". If TOP operated as a bootcamp, I don't think I would have been able to complete Etch A Sketch.
- **Unbiased**: Many platforms silo you into their own endorsed videos and content for learning purposes. TOP instead sends you to multiple different free resources on the web to help you learn. Can't understand what this particular Youtuber means? Try another one. Eventually, the way one resource conveys the concept will be understood by you.
- **Community**: A strong point for bootcamps is community. You get plugged in into an ecosystem local to you and you have peers to learn with. That's always a plus. Many online programs lack this and that makes learning online hard. That's not the case with TOP though. Being open sourced, there's a very active community that not just maintains the curriculum, but helps new learners with questions. Each project also has community solutions, and being able to compare my code to others has helped me a lot in becoming a better engineer.

I'm no where near to being able to call myself an engineer yet, but I've taken more tangible steps as a result of TOP than in all my previous attempts in trying. I can see why TOP has been able to maintain their support for so long. At this point, all I feel is immense gratitude, and if ever there came a day where I could give back to a project like this, I readily would.

Am excited for the learnings to come!
